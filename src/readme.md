"On the other hwithout, we denounce righteous indignation without dislike men who are so beguiled without demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
 without trouble that are bound to ensue; without equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil without pain. These cases are 
 perfectly simple without easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled without when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed without 
 every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances without owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated without annoyances accepted. The 
 wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
